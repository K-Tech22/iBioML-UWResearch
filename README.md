The repository dedicated to this is private to ensure code privacy. This README.md will give you a brief description of what is iBioML. 

Our main research area is pattern recognition in bioinformatics, especially, biological motif analysis. We developed various bioinformatics tools online. 

It is built using Django for Python and HTML/CSS and Bootstrap to serve a platform where ML algorithms will be shown. 

The website offers domain experts (usually graduates or faculty) to post a programming question regarding biotechnology for which developers (UW students) will provide an ML algorithm to. 

The website is currently going through final processes and will be hosted by end of fall.
